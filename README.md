# Password Generator!

## Description
Use this simple password generator to create a secure password in just a few clicks. Customize your password by selecting your parameters: password length, has or does not have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols.

This generator is entirely randomized with the modern English alphabet, numbers 0-9, and symbols !@#$%^&*.

## Application Usage


## Support
Feel free to reach out to me via GitHub.

## Roadmap
As this application develops, I plan to add an easy-copy function, as well as a strength reader, allowing the user to see exactly how strong their newly generated password is against conventional passwords.
